# rtow

* rtow is a currently simple 2 player offline game inspired from [Finger Tap Battle](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pash.fingerbattle).
* rtow is built using [LightningJS](https://lightningjs.io/) and currently only supports keyboard based user interactions. 
* refer [LightningJS docs](https://lightningjs.io/docs/#/getting-started/index) to run the app OR put the dist folder contents in an http-server.
* press 1 for player 1 (player on the Left Hand Side) and press 0 for player 2 (player on the Right Hand Side)
* the color that will be filled entirely on the screen will be the winner.
